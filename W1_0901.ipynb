        "### How is it different from phonetics\n",
        "\n",
        "Phonetics deals with the physical properties of speech sounds, such as their articultion, acoustic properties, and auditory perception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Phonetics focuses on the actual sounds themselves, while phonology examines the rules and patterns that govern how those sounds work together in a language.\n",
